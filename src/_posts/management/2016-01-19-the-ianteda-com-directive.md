Hello and thank you for visiting [ianteda.com](/), my little corner of the Internet.

I created [ianteda.com](ianteda.com) to be useful. By sharing content around ideas, thoughts and projects I am working on. Second to being useful, I wanted to build and manage my - Ian Teda - professional image, brand and authority.

The concept of being useful came from [Scott Adams](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/130338537981/the-moist-robot-ethical-code){:target="_blank"} the creator of the [Dilbert Cartoons](http://dilbert.com). The answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is not [42](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=42){:target="_blank"} but "be useful". Need a business idea? How can you be useful. What should I do in life? Be useful. How can I get people to like me? Be useful[^be-useful].

How can I be useful? By providing content around ideas, thoughts and projects, putting a URL to it (thanks [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx){:target="_blank"}) and sharing. It comes with the added bonus of helping build a brand, authority, practice my writing and develop ideas through the articulation of writing.
