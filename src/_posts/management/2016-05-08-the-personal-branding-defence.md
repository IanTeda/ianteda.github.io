## You are a brand

If you are not branding yourself, others are doing it for you. Going to a job interview, leasing a house or doing business then your name will be googled. Personal branding is about managing your name in a world of misinformation, disinformation, and semi-permanent Google records[^tim-ferriss]. “We are CEOs of our own companies: Me Inc.”, Tom Peters at Fast Company[^fast-company].

Personal branding is about telling your story (1), letting the world know what you stand for (2) and building credibility (trust) around it (3). Think of your personal brand as what people say about you when you leave the room[^dorie-clark].

### 1 - Your Story

> If people like you they will listen to you, but if they trust you, they’ll do business with you.
> <cite> — Zig Ziglar</cite>

Your story is the proof, the walk behind your talk. It demonstrates who you are and what you believe in. When telling your story don’t create two worlds be authentic, it is easier to remember. People will see through your false world, discard what you say and not trust you.

### 2 - Your Values

> If people believe they share values with a company, they will stay loyal to the brand.
> <cite> — Howard Schultz</cite>

People buy the brand not the product. In the same way people will buy into you, not what you say. [^start-with-why]. Why should someone trust you? What code to you live by?

### 3 - Build Credibility

> A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another.
> <cite> — Seth Godin</cite>

Building credibility is about continuing your story, sharing your thoughts and putting yourself out there. It builds your personal trust, authenticity and authority. A common way to build credibility is to blog (write). Put into words what you believe, think or notice about the world and then put a URL to it for others to read. You could also try doing a vlog.

## Building your Personal Brand

The key to effective thinking is asking the right questions. Below is a list of questions to help develop your personal brand. I used the questions below to develop my [landing page](https://ianteda.com) and develop content for my blog.

### Your Story

* What aspects of your life have been rewarding or you are proud to tell your mum?
* What are you passionate about? What makes you angry? What do you care about?
* What are you good at? What are your super powers? What skills have you spent time developing?
* What tagline summaries your story?

### Your Values

* What values do you live by? What priority do you put on those values?
* Hint: Think of your values as your character. Describe yourself.
* What are your ideal character traits?
* What three people do you admire? Take a deeper look at their lives?

### Your Credibility

* What content can you create? Hint: Take a look at your values.
* How can you add value through your content?
* Create good content, don't chase views.
