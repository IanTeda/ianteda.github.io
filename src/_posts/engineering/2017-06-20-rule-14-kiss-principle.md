> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.<br/><cite>-- Leonardo da Vinci</cite>

Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS).

It isn't hard to make things difficult, anybody can do that. Even someone stupid. The skill and art, is in making it simple. 

Simple is: the essence; the most important part; something that is repeatable; provides the same outcome; that if you remember anything, remember this;

The KISS principle was first adopted by the US Navy[^navy], for the design of their naval ships. With the premise being, the more complex a ship is the more likely it is to breakdown and the harder it will be to maintain. 

> Keep it simple, when you get too complex you forget the obvious. <br/><cite>— Al McGuire</cite>

It is not only true for ships, but any process, system or design. By keeping your work process simple, you are heading towards an error-free work environment. Meaning there is a decreased chance of a safety, quality or environmental incident. And if there is a failure in the process, it is less likely to have a severe consequence.

Keep your workflow simple, there is less chance of things going wrong.

> Life’s like art. You have to work hard to keep it simple and still have meaning.<br/><cite>-- Charles de Lint</cite>

As a guiding principle, design should aim to avoid complexity. The most important part of keeping a design simple, is being consistent within the design. The more variants in a solution, the more complex a design gets.

Aim to provide a solution that can be utilised in as many scenarios as possible.

> If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.<br/><cite>— Albert Einstein</cite>

You never really understand something, until you have to teach it to someone. Because it forces you to articulate a concept. It has the side-effect of reducing the concept to its most simple key elements in a logical order. So that the majority of people can understand what you are explaining.

If people don't understand you, the chances are you haven't simplified the concept enough.

> It seems that perfection is reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. <br/><cite> Antoine de Saint Exupéry</cite>

The principle is also true of writing. The art to a good article is being able to express yourself in as few words as possible. While not losing the essences of your message.
